MAP PROJECT
DESIGN PLAN
Stack: 
Create a stack of all the tiles and one of the only solutions
Check each direction. If there is a way to go to a . or $, go and push to solution stack. 
If you visit a Tile and then it has no where to go because of backtracking, pop off solution stack
Queue:
Create a queue
Remove the front element using dequeue.
Check if it is the goal tile, if it is then the solution is found.
If not the goal tile, explore each one neighboring it, and add them to the end of the queue.
Continue until the goal is found
Once it is found, backtrack and then print out the solution path.
